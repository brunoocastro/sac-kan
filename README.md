# sac-kan

A comparison between the standard implementation of [Soft Actor Critic (using MLP)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290) and a new one with [KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network)](https://github.com/mintisan/awesome-kan)


## Run Locally

To run locally, you need to install the dependencies. Do that running:

```bash
make setup
```

## TODO LIST

- [ ] Implement a method that apply the same seed for running experiments
- [ ] Create SAC Agent with KAN at Value networks
- [ ] Define the exact environments where the experiment will be ran at
- [ ] Define the metrics to the paper
